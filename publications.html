            <p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> The idea that agricultural subsidies are fully capitalized into farmland values forms the foundation of the argument that removing subsidies would drastically reduce farmland asset values. Surprisingly little evidence substantiates this claim.  Using field-level data and explicitly controlling for potentially confounding variables we find that landlords only capture between 14 and 24 cents of the marginal subsidy dollar.  The duration of the rental arrangement has a substantial effect on the incidence. Initially, landlords extract 44 cents of the marginal subsidy  dollar, but the incidence falls by 1.5 cents with each additional year of the rental arrangement.  This duration effect reveals that rental market frictions play an important role in the farmland rental market.

            <p class="coauthors">With Nigel Key and Erik Oâ€™Donoghue</p>
            <p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> We use data from the administrative files of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency to examine how the distribution of crop yields changed as individual farmers shifted into and out of the federal crop insurance program. The large panel facilitates use of fixed effects that span each combination of farmer and production practice to account for unobserved differences in farmer abilities, risk preferences and soils, in addition to fixed effects for interactions between all years and all counties to account for geographically-specific technological change, local prices, and weather.  We also account for farm-specific yield variances.  Conditional on this large set of fixed effects, we estimate the mean shift in yield and non-parametrically estimate the shift in the distribution around the conditional mean associated with enrollment in crop insurance.  Because differences between farmer and land types have been accounted for (i.e., controlling for adverse selection), the estimated shifts in yield distributions likely reflect moral hazard.  For most crops in most states we find insurance is associated with statistically significant but small downward shifts in average yield.  The largest shifts occur for cotton and rice, the highest-value of five crops considered. By integrating the estimated shift in yield distributions over actual indemnities paid, we provide estimates of the total indemnities paid due to moral hazard. Our results indicate moral hazard accounted for an estimated $53.7 million in indemnities between 1992 and 2001, which amounts to 0.9% of indemnities paid to the insured crops and states considered.
