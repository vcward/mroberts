                        <p class="coauthors">With Arlan Brucal</p>
                        <p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> We examine the effect of energy efficiency standards on the clothes washers market
                            using a constant-quality price index constructed from same-model price changes for a significant
                            majority of clothes washer models sold in the United States between 2001 and 2011. We find constant-quality
                            prices fell over time, while quality increased, particularly around times energy standards changed.
                            We estimate total welfare changes by assuming the difference between average price and constant-quality
                            price indicates average quality. Further examination shows product entry and exit are associated
                            with changes federal standard for energy efficiency. With policy changes implicitly coordinating
                            entry and exit, average vintage sharply falls when standards change. Controlling for individual
                            model and time effects, we find that lower average vintage is associated with more rapidly falling
                            prices, an effect we attribute to increased competition. We also find a strong relationship between
                            clothes washer prices and average vintage of the same manufacturer, which indicates cannibalism
                            explains much of the declining price of clothes washers over time. We apply the same methodology
                            to other appliances (clothes dryer, room air conditioners and refrigerators) which did not experience
                            simultaneous efficiency standard changes between 2001 and 2011. We see the same cannibalism in
                            the market for clothes dryers, but not for room air conditioners or refrigerators. We also find
                            notable improvements both in the characteristics of clothes washers that directly improve energy
                            efficiency and those that promote convenience and space-saving. Energy efficiency standards appear
                            to facilitate more rapid innovation and price declines.

                        <p class="coauthors">With A. Nam Tran</p>
                        <p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> When demand for a commodity shifts permanently outward, the effect of the shift
                            on the level and volatility of prices will differ over the short run and long run depending on:
                            (1) how early the market anticipates the demand shock; (2) the elasticities of supply and demand
                            in the new environment as compared to the old environment; and (3) inventories available when
                            news of the impending demand shock arrives. We analyze the relative importance of these three
                            features on food prices using a modified version of the storage model that allows demand to change
                            over time. Model parameters are found using a grid search that minimizes the difference between
                            simulated and observed data. We then use the model to evaluate the effect of the US ethanol mandate
                            on world food prices. In line with earlier studies, we find that the US ethanol mandate, by shifting
                            the world demand out by more than 5 percent in 2015, can account for 11 to 30 percent of the
                            food price increase between 2005 and 2011 depending on demand and supply elasticities before
                            and after the demand shift. Unlike earlier studies, the analysis shows how the ethanol mandate
                            may have exacerbated the initial price spike or increased volatility during the transition to
                            the new demand environment.

                        <p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> Mounting evidence indicates climate change will adversely influence agricultural
                            crop yields and cause greater year-to-year variability. This paper considers how a rational,
                            forward-looking and competitive commodity market would account for these anticipated changes
                            and thereby influence time path of storage, prices, price volatility, and social welfare. We
                            forecast 1600 hypothetical yield paths from 2000 to 2080 using estimates from a recent global
                            statistical analysis of weather and crop yields combined with projections from 16 climate models.
                            We then extend the dynamic competitive storage model to account for land response to price and
                            anticipated yield shift. We simulate 1600 stochastic-equilibrium price paths under climate change
                            relative to a baseline of stable prices using our hypothetical yield paths together with estimated
                            demand and supply elasticities and storage cost from the literature. Our results indicate that,
                            under the impact of climate change, world crop price level will increase twofold and world crop
                            price volatility will increase fivefold between 2000 and 2080. Welfare analysis suggests that
                            by 2020, the world would have welfare loss equivalent to food for 180 to 200 million people annually.

                        <p class="coauthors">With Erik Oâ€™Donoghue and Nigel Key</p>
                        <p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> We use data from the administrative files of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
                            Risk Management Agency to examine how the distribution of crop yields changed as individual farmers
                            shifted into and out of the federal crop insurance program. The large panel facilitates use of
                            fixed effects that span each combination of farmer and production practice to account for unobserved
                            differences in farmer abilities, risk preferences and soils, in addition to fixed effects for
                            interactions between all years and all counties to account for geographically-specific technological
                            change, local prices, and weather. We also account for farm-specific yield variances. Conditional
                            on this large set of fixed effects, we estimate the mean shift in yield and non-parametrically
                            estimate the shift in the distribution around the conditional mean associated with enrollment
                            incrop insurance. Because differences between farmer and land types have been accounted for (i.e.,
                            controlling for adverse selection), the estimated shifts in yield distributions likely reflect
                            moral hazard. For most crops in most states we find insurance is associated with statistically
                            signi cant but small downward shifts in average yield. The largest shifts occur for cotton and
                            rice, the highest-value of ve crops considered. By integrating the estimated shift in yield distributions
                            over actual indemnities paid, we provide estimates of the total indemnities paid due to moral
                            hazard. Our results indicate moral hazard accounted for an estimated $53.7 million in indemnities
                            between 1992 and 2001, which amounts to 0.9% of indemnities paid to the insured crops and states
                            considered.

                        <p class="coauthors">With Daniel Hellerstein and Nathaniel Higgins</p>
                        <p class="abstract"><b>Abstract:</b> We study multiple-unit asymmetric procurement auctions wherein sellers from two
                            classes draw costs from different distributions. When sellers are asymmetric, a cost-minimizing
                            buyer discriminates among classes of sellers to enhance competition. Establishing a quotaâ€”a limit
                            on the number of offers that can be accepted from any one classâ€”discriminates simply and effectively.
                            The quota increases demand scarcity from the perspective of low- cost sellers, which causes them
                            to lower their offers. To solve for approximate equilibrium strategies of asymmetric auctions
                            with and without a quota, we develop a new method that is similar but distinctly different from
                            the constrained strategic equilibrium (CSE) approach. The new method finds the constrained strategies
                            that minimize the expected gain from a randomly chosen seller unilaterally deviating from the
                            constrained strategy. We find quota can enhance competition and lower total procurement cost.
                            We subject the same auctions to laboratory testing and find savings from quota in excess of that
                            predicted by the approximate equilibrium strategies. This study is first to combine theory and
                            experimental evidence of auctions with quotas, though similar mechanisms are widely used in practice.
                            Because the mechanism is widely used to promote social goals and can also lead to better outcomes
                            for the buyer, our findings have both positive and normative implications. One potentially interesting
                            application of quota auctions would be for large-scale procurement of ecosystem services like
                            carbon sequestration.
